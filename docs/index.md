Before we get to programming, we need to download the latest version of Lavalink and Application.yml:
> GitHub Release: https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/releases  
> Application.yml: https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example  
> CI Builds: https://ci.fredboat.com/viewLog.html?buildId=lastSuccessful&buildTypeId=Lavalink_Build&tab=artifacts&guest=1

To start Lavalink, open a new shell window where Lavalink is located at and type in: `java -jar Lavalink.jar`. \
If you happen to have multiple JAVA versions installed, please make sure the PATH is pointing to the latest version of JAVA.

> [!WARNING]
>  It is recommended to put Lavalink and application.yml in the same directory.  You'd be better off creating a new folder called Lavalink server and place everything in it.  


> [!CAUTION]
> The new version of Lavalink requires you have to JAVA 10+. Download the latest JAVA version that is 10+ at least.
